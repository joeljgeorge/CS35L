First I plugged in the Beaglebone, and navigated to the external storage drive
in File Explorer. I then clicked on START.htm, and then downloaded the 64 bit
installer. However, whenever I tried to run the installer, it always failed. I
found that this is because the installer is not compatible with Windows 10, so I
used the link that another student linked to:
https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-getting-started/blob/master/Drivers/Windows/BONE_D64.exe. This
downloaded all the necessary drivers.

Setting up Beaglebone
I opened up Putty, and set the Host Name to 192.168.7.2. I then hit Open. 

I logged in as root, and left the password blank.

To connect to wifi, I ran sudo connmanctl:

Within connmanctl, I ran:
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect (wifi address for UCLA_WEB_RES) 
quit

Having connected to UCLA_WEB_RES, I ran:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

I also installed XMing on my local machine.

Client:
I opened Putty, opened the SSH tab, and then navigated to X11. I then clicked
'Enable X11 Forwarding', and set the Putty 'Host Name' to 192.168.7.2. I set up
all the connmanctl wifi stuff again, except this time connecting to
UCLA_WIFI_RES. To connect to WIFI_RES, I connected using connmanctl and then
ran:
firefox 

In firefox, I ran 1.1.1.1 to pull up the login authentication screen, and I
logged into UCLA_WIFI_RES. From there, I ran:

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i joel1@164.67.84.32 (joel1 was my username on the server,
164.67.84.32) 

To then ssh into the server:
ssh joel1@164.67.84.32
ssh -X joel1@164.67.84.32

Once in, I ran firefox again, and firefox ran in Xming.

Setting up the server:
I ran ssh-keygen to generate public and private keys.

I then ran the following commands:

sudo useradd -d /home/nikhil -m nikswam to create an account for the client

sudo passwd nikswam to set a passwd for this user

cd /home/nikswam and sudo mkdir .ssh to create an .ssh directory for this user

sudo chown -R nikswam .ssh and sudo chmod 700 .ssh to change permissions for user

Client was able to login and firefox successfully opened after he logged in to my server
