1. I used:

emacs hw9.txt 

to create a file to log my actions for the hw section of this lab.

2. To checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repo into a new branch named
"quote", I ran:

cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. I realized that this patch must not include any extraneous files, so I moved
git-log.txt, git-tag.txt, quote-patch.txt, and quote-3.0-patch.txt into the root directory:

mv *filename* ../*filename*

To install my change into this new branch, I ran the patch command:

patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

I got the output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c
patching file tests/help-version


5. I opened emacs by running the following command:

emacs 

And then used the "add-change-log-entry-other-window" command (C-x 4 a) to
create the ChangeLog entry for my patch:

        * src/cmp.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe.
        * src/diff.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe
                      (also in string literal).
        * src/diff3.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe
                      (also in string literal).
        * src/dir.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe.
        * src/sdiff.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe.
        * src/util.c: Grave accents were replaced with standard apostrophe.
6. To add the files to the commit, I used:

git add .

To actually push this commit, I ran:

git commit -F ChangeLog

I then confirmed that this commit was pushed with:

git log

which output:

commit 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112
Author: Jim Meyering <meyering@redhat.com>

    version 3.0
:

Since my commit was included in the commit history log, I was reassured that it
went through. 

7.I then generated the formatted-patch.txt by using this command:

git format-patch -1 --stdout HEAD > formatted-patch.txt

The -1 tells the command to only use the last commit, which is my commit.

8. I used Ashwin Dharne's patch. I first ran:

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

to create the temporary partner branch. I then ran:

git am < ../ashwin_formatted-patch.txt

This was the output:

Applying: 2017-12-10 Joel John George <george@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

8. I then ran:

./bootstrap (linux server 09)
./configure (linux server 03)
make (linux server 03)

I had to run export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH again before running
./bootstrap and make.

I then ran diff - ., which output:

diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

Running diff --help also output the correctly modified quotations for example:

-l, --paginate                pass output through 'pr' to paginate it

9. I then ran:

make distdir

This output a lot of verbose text. Once this was completed, I ran:

emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog

The emacs file that was opened contained my ChangeLog entry!

9. For this last command, I had to open up a new terminal session with the X11
Forwarding enabled. When I navigated to ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and ran gitk, I
got the error gitk: command not found. To fix this, I used:

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

And then ran gitk. I've attached a screenshot of the graphical user
interface. The newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25 was titled,
"Improved glitch fix", and was submitted by Joakim Verona.
